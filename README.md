<h1>What and Why?</h1>
<p>
The HNRN stack is one among many node.js stacks. But compared to other
stacks with the help of Hasura and GraphQL, we are offloading most of the
backend jobs to Hasura. The Authentication and storage are also offloaded
to Hasura Backend Plus. Because Authorization is already part of Hasura it
is also not a headache. The only remaining part for a backend developer is
database schema design and additional Business logic. Because everything
is typescript based it guarantees a level of protection. React combined
with Antd Helps to make better UI.
